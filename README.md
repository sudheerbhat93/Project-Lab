# 🚀 Project Lab

A personal sandbox for exploring **web hosting, deployment, automation, and cloud workflows**.  
This is where I document my journey as I experiment with AWS, GitHub, CI/CD, DNS, SSL, and other DevOps tools.

The purpose of this repository is to record my journey, processes, and experiments in deploying my personal portfolio website **[sudheerbhat.in](https://sudheerbhat.in)**.
